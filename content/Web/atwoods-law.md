> “Any application that _can_ be written in JavaScript, _will_ eventually be written in JavaScript.”

Was first mentioned in its article [All programming is web programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/all-programming-is-web-programming/) of 2009 where Jeff Atwood talks about the death of the desktop application and the surge on web apps substituting them. He argues that the reason of this is the use of [[the-rule-of-least-power | The Rule of Least Power]] where the web is the embodiment of doing the simplest things that could work for a given piece of software.

Also, he argues, if the objective of a piece of software is to be experienced by as many people as possible, the web is the most efficient, ubiquitous, and immediate distribution network ever to exist. So, he concludes its law given that JavaScript is the native code of the web.
