This is my collection of web design inspiration sources. I use them to get ideas for my personal projects and to keep up with the latest trends in web design. They are a mix of libraries, websites, and website aggregators. I hope you find them useful!

- **[Call To inspiration](https://calltoinspiration.com/)**
  - A curated collection of screenshots of real websites organized by their type of UI element, like for example carousels, or common sections of a page, such as a pricing section.

- **[SVG Hub](https://svghub.vercel.app/)**
  - A library of 70 SVG scribbles, shapes, and other elements that you can use in your projects.

- **[Landing Folio](https://www.landingfolio.com/)**
  - A website that showcases landing pages from different products. It has a great search feature to find landing pages by industry, type, or style.

- **[shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**
  - A beautifully designed components library that you can copy and paste into your apps. I love their design and the philosophy of "owning" the component itself with their copy/paste integration method. I've used it in pretty much all my projects.
