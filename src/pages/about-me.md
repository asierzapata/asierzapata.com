Hi there! I'm Asier! I’m a software engineer currently working at [Edpuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com), a fantastic EdTech company, where I’m a Senior Staff Engineer. My day is split between helping my team grow and leading different projects, from the technical side to the product side.

I love working on the Education sector, where I can help teachers make their lives easier and focuse on their students as much as possible.

I also love everything tech-related, from keeping up with industry developments and trends to geeking out for every new tech device.

When I’m not coding, you can find me hiking, or just exploring new places with my camera in hand.

This is my digital garden, where I write about my thoughts, learnings, and experiences. I hope you find something useful here!
