Hi there! I'm Asier! I’m a software engineer currently working at [Edpuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com), a fantastic EdTech company, where I’m an Engineering Manager (or whatever the team needs, I like to wear many hats). My day is split between helping my team grow and leading different projects, from the technical side to the product side.

I love working on the Education sector, where I can help people get the best online education. I’m passionate about building products that make a difference in people’s lives, and I’m always looking for new ways to improve the learning experience.

I also love everything tech-related, from keeping up with industry developments and trends to geeking out for every new tech device.

This is my digital garden, where I write about my thoughts, learnings, and experiences. I hope you find something useful here! Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asierzapata) if you want to chat about anything!
